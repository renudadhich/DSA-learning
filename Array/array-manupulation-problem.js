/**
 * Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, 
 * for each operation add a value to each of the array element between two given indices, inclusive. 
 * Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.
 * Example : 
 * n =10;
 * queries = [[1,5,3],[4,8,7],[6,9,1]];
 * Queries are interpreted as follows:
     a b k
    1 5 3
    4 8 7
    6 9 1
Add the values of  k between the indices a and b  inclusive:
